# Serverless Validator

Validates [Serverless](serverless.com) YML files.

## Usage

If haskell, stack are installed on you system simply clone this repo and type: `./src/Serverlessvalidator.hs path/to/serverless.yml`. The script leverages stack's [scripting](https://haskell-lang.org/tutorial/stack-script) capabilities that is Stack will take care of downloading all the necessary dependencies and run the validator, just sit back and wait for it to be finished (it might take a bit the first time). For example, if the `runtime` string in `serverless.yml` is not valid, the ouput will be something like:

```
$ ./src/Serverlessvalidator.hs path/to/serverless-wrong-runtime.yml
'serverless-wrong-runtime.yml' is not valid
AesonException "Error in $.provider.runtime: failed to parse field provider: failed to parse field runtime: Unsupported runtime 'nodejs'. Choose one among: 'nodejs4.3', 'java8', 'python2.8'"

```

## Usage with Docker

If haskell, stack etc. are not installed on your system, then docker comes to the rescue. Build the image using the `Dockerfile` using something like `docker build -t serverless-validator .` and then run it with `docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp serveless-validator path/relative/to/the/current/path/to/serverless.yml`. Beware: the size of the docker image is an outrageous 1.8 GB!!!
